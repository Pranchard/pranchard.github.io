# Important

When scrolling through member lists and long channel lists, the scrollbar randomly gets stuck and starts flickering. To get rid of this annoyance you can try the below fixes:

- Fix 1

Fix 1 is by downloading a plugin called **SmoothScrollPowercord.**

- Fix 2

Fix 2 is by unloading a part of the theme, this will make the channel list and members list a little ugly so only use this if Fix 1 doesn't work for you.

**Step 1:** Go to ``src`` folder and open the ``source.scss`` file.

**Step 2:** Inside ``source.scss`` file remove/comment out every line that starts with: ``@use "lists/``

You might need to repeat this thing sometimes when you update the theme.

# Explanation

## What is cannabis?

> Cannabis is a theme for BetterDiscord that was created by combining multiple themes.

## Why Cannabis?

> As I wrote in the description, "sometimes we want to taste different things", and as I wrote above, consider the name Cannabis as an analogy, as it is a combination of multiple themes.
